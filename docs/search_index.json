The course consists of five parts: i) Part 0: General Introduction to Bayesian inference, ii) Part 1: The Gaussian intercepts-only model, iii) Part 2: Linear regression with a dichotomous predictor, iv) Part 3: Multi-level model with repeated measures, v) Part 4: Multi-level model based on informed priors. 1.2 Links to videos: Here are the videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7hlAJ6eWI4&amp;t=213s XXXX XXX XXXX "],["part-i-the-gaussian-intercepts-only-model.html", "Chapter 2 Part I: The Gaussian intercepts-only model", " Chapter 2 Part I: The Gaussian intercepts-only model #if you don&#39;t have the pacman package loaded on your computer, uncomment the next line, install pacman, and load in the required packages #install.packages(&#39;pacman&#39;) #load the required packages: pacman::p_load(tidyverse, glue, data.table, dplyr, moments, tidybayes, ggplot2, ggridges, plyr, ellipse, brms, cowplot, viridis) PART I: Introduction to the data: Our research question concerns the hyperarticulation hypothesis of infant-directed speech. Do caregivers produce more peripheral vowels in infant-directed speech (IDS) compared to adult-directed speech (ADS)? To answer this question, we manually analysed 9267 extracted vowel tokens from individual caregivers’ IDS and ADS. In order eliminate inter-individual differences in formant values that occur due to physiological characteristics, we first z-score-normalised the formant data according to participant and then computed the total area of each caregiver’s ADS and IDS vowel space. We used this measure to calculate a standardised mean difference score: Cohen’s d. The dataset we will analyse here consists of the following information: i) Subject (i.e. unique participant pseudonym), ii) Register (i.e. the speech style used - adult-directed speech (ADS) vs. infant-directed speech (IDS)), iii) ArticulationS (i.e. the dependent variable - represents a standardised version of the vowel space), iv) ChildSex (i.e. male vs. female), v) ChildAge (i.e. from 11 m to 24 m), vi) First_child (whether this is the caregiver’s first child).

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter ??. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.
