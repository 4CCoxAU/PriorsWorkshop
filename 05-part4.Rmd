# Recommendations

## Where to go for further study
1. We would highly recommend McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking book and online video lectures: (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJK6_DZvcMqNSzQdEkzvzA)
2. Potsdam Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology (https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2021/)
3. Michael Betancourt has awesome materials (once you already master McElreath’s level) (https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/)
