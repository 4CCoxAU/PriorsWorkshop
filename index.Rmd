# Part I: Introduction

This is a website that provides the lectures and code for our workshop on how to set priors and the Bayesian workflow.

## Structure of this Workshop 

This workshop takes you through how to set priors in a step-by-step fashion. The course consists of five parts: 
        i) Part 1: General Introduction to Bayesian inference,
        ii) Part 2: The Gaussian intercepts-only model, 
        iii) Part 3: Linear regression with a dichotomous predictor,
        iv) Part 4: Multi-level model with repeated measures,
        v) Part 5: Multi-level model based on informed priors.
